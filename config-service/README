To make the configuration service we only need one dependency "spring-cloud-config-server".
  
Since i was working with an older tutorial, it needed another dependency "spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap",
but that has changed so i should check how to do it without it.

To make the config server work, you need to add the configuration files that the server will expose in a repository(There are other methods too).
To do that i added a folder named "config-data" to store all the configurations of my services. And added an bootstrap.yml file like this:
## YAML Template.
---
server: 
    port: 8081
    
spring:
    cloud:
        config:
            server:
                git:
                    uri: https://github.com/rubenpineda92/wizeline-cloud-project.git (The url of the repository)
                    searchPaths: config-data (The path where all the config files are)
                    username: ${GIT_USER} (My git user and password hidden because reasons)
                    password: ${GIT_PASSWORD}
                    default-label: main (Since git changed its default branch from master to main i had to add this) 
    security:
        user:
            name: root
            password: password1

Then i had to add the "spring-cloud-starter-config" dependency to all my services and change the application.properties
file in the resources folder for a bootstrap.yml file with this configuration:
  ## YAML Template.

spring:
    application:
        name: crm-service (The name of the properties file to look up).
    cloud:
        config:
            uri: http://localhost:8081 (The url of the configuration server)
            username: root (basic user and password security)
            password: password1
